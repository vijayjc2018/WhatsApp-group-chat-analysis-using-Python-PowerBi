Nowadays, WhatsApp became the preferred communication mode, which allows us to create groups and share our thought. Sometimes, we might be in a group for a long time as a silent member. Similarly, there could be many other members who donâ€™t contribute. This analysis helps us to get insight into the numbers, active members, and the message distribution in a week. In order to achieve this, I have used Python for data preparation and PowerBI to create the visualization.
